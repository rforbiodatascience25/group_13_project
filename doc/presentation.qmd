# Discussion (Joshua)

## Biological Interpretation

- Receptor classification
  - Valine, Glycine, Tryptophan, Serine, and Proline are the most informative amino acids for receptor prediction
  - Proline and Glycine are alpha-helix and beta-sheet breakers
  - Proline is highly relevant for loops and turns

## Limitations and Future Directions

- Success of the analysis?
  - prediction of Cys-loop and Glutamate ion receptors very accurate
  - other receptors are not well predicted due to lack of representation in the data set
- What could be explored more in detail
  - test model against larger variety of background proteins
