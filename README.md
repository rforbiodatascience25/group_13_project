## Dataset Neurotransmitter Receptors & Protein Sequences

Neurotransmitter receptors are key proteins in neuronal communication that detect chemical signals and translate those into cellular responses to regulate a variety of biological processes.

Many of these work as ionic channels activated by ligands and their aminoacid (Aa) sequence determines properties as ion selectivity, channel gating dynamics or subunit organization.

Some Aa have strong influence on the structure and function of the receptors, favoring the recognition of the ligand and channel activation.

Understanding these principles, a relation between Aa sequences and type of receptor can be found.


## Rendering

To render the project please run

``` r
source("R/98_render.R")
```

in a terminal. DO NOT RENDER THE QMD or the project yourself, or stuff will break!
